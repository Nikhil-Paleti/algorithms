## ‚úÖ Core Algorithms (Must-Know)

### 1. DFS (Depth-First Search)
- **Purpose:** Graph traversal, pathfinding, connected components, cycle detection.  
- **Complexity:** O(V + E).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Recursive or stack-based.  
  - Useful for detecting back edges (cycle detection in directed graphs).  

### 2. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- **Purpose:** Shortest path in **unweighted** graphs, level-order traversal.  
- **Complexity:** O(V + E).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Uses a queue.  
  - Great for shortest path problems where edge weights = 1.  

### 3. Topological Sort
- **Purpose:** Order vertices in a DAG such that all edges go forward.  
- **Complexity:** O(V + E).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Implement via DFS (postorder) or BFS (Kahn‚Äôs algorithm).  
  - Detects cycles (if topological order is impossible).  
  - Used in scheduling and dependency problems.  

### 4. Union‚ÄìFind (Disjoint Set Union, DSU)
- **Purpose:** Track connected components, cycle detection, Kruskal‚Äôs MST.  
- **Complexity:** ~O(Œ±(V)) per operation (inverse Ackermann, almost constant).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Supports union by rank + path compression.  
  - Core building block for Kruskal‚Äôs.  

### 5. Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Single-source shortest paths in weighted graphs (non-negative weights).  
- **Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with heap.  
- **Notes:**  
  - Greedy algorithm.  
  - Cannot handle negative weights.  

### 6. Bellman‚ÄìFord Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Single-source shortest paths with **negative weights**, detect negative cycles.  
- **Complexity:** O(V * E).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Dynamic programming style.  
  - Works even when negative edges exist.  

### 7. Floyd‚ÄìWarshall Algorithm
- **Purpose:** All-pairs shortest paths.  
- **Complexity:** O(V¬≥).  
- **Notes:**  
  - DP-based algorithm.  
  - Handles negative edges but not negative cycles.  

### 8. Prim‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).  
- **Complexity:** O(E log V) with heap.  
- **Notes:**  
  - Greedy: expand MST from a seed node.  

### 9. Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Purpose:** Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).  
- **Complexity:** O(E log V).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Sort edges, use Union‚ÄìFind to add safe edges.  
  - Simpler to code than Prim‚Äôs.  

### 10. Eulerian Path and Circuit
- **Purpose:** Path/circuit that uses every edge exactly once.  
- **Conditions:**  
  - Undirected:  
    - Circuit ‚Üí all vertices have even degree.  
    - Path ‚Üí exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree.  
  - Directed:  
    - Circuit ‚Üí indegree = outdegree for all vertices.  
    - Path ‚Üí one node with outdegree = indegree + 1, one with indegree = outdegree + 1, rest equal.  
- **Algorithm:** Hierholzer‚Äôs Algorithm (O(E)).  
- **Notes:**  
  - Used in ‚ÄúReconstruct Itinerary‚Äù type problems.  

### 11. Cycle Detection
- **Undirected Graphs:**  
  - Use Union‚ÄìFind or DFS (check back edges).  
- **Directed Graphs:**  
  - Use DFS with recursion stack (detect back edges).  
- **Complexity:** O(V + E).

## ‚ö° High ROI Additions (Good Next Step)

### 12. Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)
- **Algorithms:** Kosaraju‚Äôs or Tarjan‚Äôs.  
- **Purpose:** Decompose directed graphs into SCCs.  
- **Applications:** 2-SAT, condensation graphs, dependency analysis.  

### 13. Bipartite Graph Check
- **Purpose:** Check if graph is 2-colorable.  
- **Method:** BFS/DFS with alternate coloring.  
- **Applications:** Matching problems, cycle parity detection.  

### 14. DAG Shortest Path
- **Purpose:** Fast shortest paths in DAGs.  
- **Method:** Topological sort + relaxation.  
- **Complexity:** O(V + E).
